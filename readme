This project reads logs from CSV files and exposes analytics through REST API.

The CSV file is read line by line using csv.reader.
This means the app can handle very large files (GBs) without running out of memory.
Instead of storing every log entry, only the required analytics are stored.
Multithreading is used since file parsing is I/O bound. Threads parse chunks which update shared counters in a single lock.
FastAPI is used to expose the required services, which are fast since they read from pre-aggregated data.
